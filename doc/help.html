		<h3 id="SPARTA">What is SPARTA?</h3>
<p>SPARTA is a python GUI application which simplifies network infrastructure penetration testing by aiding the penetration tester in the scanning and enumeration phase. It allows the tester to save time by having point-and-click access to his toolkit and by displaying all tool output in a convenient way. If little time is spent setting up commands and tools, more time can be spent focusing on analysing results.</p>
<h3 id="Documentation">Features</h3>
<p>
* Nmap XML output importer<br />
* Any tool that can be run from a terminal, can be run from SPARTA<br />
* Default credentials check for most common services<br />
* If any usernames/passwords are found by Hydra they are stored in internal wordlists which can then be used on other targets in the same network (breaking news: people reuse passwords)<br />
* Ability to mark hosts that you have already worked on so that you do not waste time looking at them again<br />
* Screenshot taker so that you do not waste time on less interesting web servers</p>
<h3>Requirements</h3>
<p>It is recommended that Kali Linux is used as it already has most tools installed, however SPARTA would most likely also work in Debian based systems.</p>
<p>Kali (preferred):<br />
<em><strong>apt-get install python-elixir</strong></em></p>
<p>Ubuntu 12.04+ (untested)<br />
<em><strong>apt-get install python-elixir python-qt4</strong></em></p>
<p>Other than these, the following tools are required for SPARTA to have its minimum functionality:<br />
&#8211; nmap (for adding hosts)<br />
&#8211; hydra (for the brute tab)<br />
&#8211; cutycapt (for screenshots)</p>
<p>In Kali Linux these can be installed with:<br />
<em><strong>apt-get install nmap hydra cutycapt</strong></em></p>

<h3 id="Feedback">Feedback</h3>
<p>We value your feedback as it will help us turn SPARTA into an even more awesome tool!</p>
<p>Also, since we are penetration testers and not developers there&#8217;s a chance you will find a few bugs.</p>
